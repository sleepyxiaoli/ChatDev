To address the customer's request for a classic Snake game with a scoring system and game-over detection, we should consider the most suitable product modality. 

Given that the task involves creating a visualized game, the "Application" modality using Python seems to be the most appropriate choice. This would allow us to implement the game mechanics effectively and provide an interactive experience for users.

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that creating the Snake game as an "Application" using Python is the best approach. This modality will enable us to incorporate the necessary game features, such as the scoring system and game-over detection, while providing an engaging user experience. 

Let's finalize our decision. Do you have any further input, or should we proceed with this choice?

Here is a new customer's task: 创建一个经典的贪吃蛇游戏，包含计分系统和游戏结束检测.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a classic Snake game in Python with a scoring system and game-over detection, we will use the Pygame library for the graphical user interface. Below is the outline of the core classes and functions that will be necessary for our implementation:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **Snake**
   - **Attributes**: `body`, `direction`, `speed`
   - **Methods**: 
     - `move()`: Updates the position of the snake based on its direction.
     - `grow()`: Increases the size of the snake.
     - `check_collision()`: Checks for collisions with itself or the walls.

2. **Food**
   - **Attributes**: `position`
   - **Methods**: 
     - `spawn()`: Randomly places food on the screen.

3. **Game**
   - **Attributes**: `snake`, `food`, `score`, `screen`, `clock`
   - **Methods**: 
     - `run()`: Main game loop.
     - `draw()`: Draws the snake, food, and score on the screen.
     - `check_game_over()`: Checks if the game is over.

4. **Main**
   - **Function**: 
     - `main()`: Initializes the game and starts the main loop.

Now, let's implement the code in multiple files.

### File: main.py

```python
'''
Main file to run the Snake game.
'''

import pygame
from game import Game

def main():
    pygame.init()
    game = Game()
    game.run()
    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### File: game.py

```python
'''
Game class that manages the game logic and rendering.
'''

import pygame
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.width = 600
        self.height = 400
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()
        self.score = 0
        self.game_over = False

    def run(self):
        while not self.game_over:
            self.handle_events()
            self.snake.move()
            self.check_game_over()
            if self.snake.body[0] == self.food.position:
                self.snake.grow()
                self.food.spawn()
                self.score += 1
            self.draw()
            self.clock.tick(15)

    def handle_events(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                self.game_over = True
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    self.snake.direction = (0, -1)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    self.snake.direction = (0, 1)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                    self.snake.direction = (-1, 0)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                    self.snake.direction = (1, 0)

    def draw(self):
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        self.snake.draw(self.screen)
        self.food.draw(self.screen)
        self.display_score()
        pygame.display.flip()

    def display_score(self):
        font = pygame.font.SysFont("Arial", 25)
        score_surface = font.render(f"Score: {self.score}", True, (255, 255, 255))
        self.screen.blit(score_surface, (10, 10))

    def check_game_over(self):
        head = self.snake.body[0]
        if head[0] < 0 or head[0] >= self.width or head[1] < 0 or head[1] >= self.height or head in self.snake.body[1:]:
            self.game_over = True
```

### File: snake.py

```python
'''
Snake class that represents the snake in the game.
'''

import pygame

class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(10, 10), (9, 10), (8, 10)]
        self.direction = (1, 0)  # Start moving to the right
        self.speed = 10

    def move(self):
        head_x, head_y = self.body[0]
        new_head = (head_x + self.direction[0], head_y + self.direction[1])
        self.body.insert(0, new_head)
        self.body.pop()  # Remove the tail

    def grow(self):
        self.body.append(self.body[-1])  # Add a new segment at the tail

    def draw(self, screen):
        for segment in self.body:
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 255, 0), (segment[0] * self.speed, segment[1] * self.speed, self.speed, self.speed))

    def check_collision(self):
        head = self.body[0]
        return head in self.body[1:]  # Check if the head collides with the body
```

### File: food.py

```python
'''
Food class that represents the food in the game.
'''

import pygame
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = (0, 0)
        self.spawn()

    def spawn(self):
        self.position = (random.randint(0, 59), random.randint(0, 39))  # Random position in the grid

    def draw(self, screen):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), (self.position[0] * 10, self.position[1] * 10, 10, 10))
```

### Summary

This implementation consists of four files: `main.py`, `game.py`, `snake.py`, and `food.py`. The game initializes a Pygame window, handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the snake and food on the screen. The scoring system is implemented, and the game detects when the snake collides with itself or the walls, ending the game accordingly. 

Make sure to install Pygame before running the game using the command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

You can run the game by executing the `main.py` file.
