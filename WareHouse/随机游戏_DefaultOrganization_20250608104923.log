To address the customer's request for an interesting game, we should consider the most suitable product modality. Given that games typically require interactivity and visual engagement, the "Application" modality seems to be the best fit. It allows us to create a fully functional game using Python, which can provide the necessary features and user experience.

What are your thoughts on this?

I agree that the "Application" modality is the most suitable choice for creating an interesting game. It allows us to leverage Python's capabilities for interactivity and graphics, which are essential for a gaming experience. Additionally, we can implement various game mechanics and features that will engage users effectively.

Shall we proceed with this decision?

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "生成一个比较有意思的游戏".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
