To fulfill the customer's request for a classic Snake game with a scoring system and game-over detection, we should consider the most suitable product modality. 

Given that the game requires interactivity and real-time updates, an application developed in Python would be ideal. This would allow us to implement the game mechanics effectively and provide a smooth user experience.

What are your thoughts on this modality?

I agree that developing the Snake game as a Python application is the best choice. It allows for the necessary interactivity and real-time gameplay, which are essential for a classic game experience. Additionally, Python has libraries that can facilitate game development, making it a practical option.

Let's proceed with this modality. Do you have any further thoughts, or should we finalize our decision?

I completely agree with your assessment. The Python application modality not only meets the requirements for interactivity and real-time gameplay but also leverages existing libraries that can expedite our development process. 

Since we both concur on this choice, I believe we can finalize our decision.

Here is a new customer's task: 创建一个经典的贪吃蛇游戏，包含计分系统和游戏结束检测.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a classic Snake game in Python with a scoring system and game-over detection, we will use the Pygame library for the graphical user interface. Below is the outline of the core classes and functions that will be necessary for the game:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **Snake**: 
   - **Attributes**: `body`, `direction`, `score`
   - **Methods**: `move()`, `grow()`, `check_collision()`

2. **Food**: 
   - **Attributes**: `position`
   - **Methods**: `spawn()`

3. **Game**: 
   - **Attributes**: `snake`, `food`, `screen`, `clock`, `running`
   - **Methods**: `run()`, `draw()`, `handle_events()`, `update()`, `check_game_over()`

4. **Main Function**: 
   - Initializes the game and starts the main loop.

### File Structure
- `snake_game.py`: Main file to run the game.
- `snake.py`: Contains the Snake class.
- `food.py`: Contains the Food class.
- `game.py`: Contains the Game class.

Now, let's implement the code for each file.

### 1. Main File: `snake_game.py`

```python
'''
Main file to run the Snake game.
'''

import pygame
from game import Game

def main():
    pygame.init()
    game = Game()
    game.run()
    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 2. Snake Class: `snake.py`

```python
'''
Class representing the Snake in the game.
'''

import pygame

class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(100, 100), (90, 100), (80, 100)]
        self.direction = (10, 0)
        self.score = 0

    def move(self):
        head_x, head_y = self.body[0]
        new_head = (head_x + self.direction[0], head_y + self.direction[1])
        self.body.insert(0, new_head)
        self.body.pop()

    def grow(self):
        self.body.append(self.body[-1])
        self.score += 1

    def check_collision(self, width, height):
        head_x, head_y = self.body[0]
        return head_x < 0 or head_x >= width or head_y < 0 or head_y >= height or len(self.body) != len(set(self.body))
```

### 3. Food Class: `food.py`

```python
'''
Class representing the Food in the game.
'''

import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.position = self.spawn(width, height)

    def spawn(self, width, height):
        x = random.randint(0, (width - 10) // 10) * 10
        y = random.randint(0, (height - 10) // 10) * 10
        return (x, y)
```

### 4. Game Class: `game.py`

```python
'''
Class to manage the game logic and rendering.
'''

import pygame
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.width = 600
        self.height = 400
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.running = True
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food(self.width, self.height)

    def run(self):
        while self.running:
            self.handle_events()
            self.update()
            self.draw()
            self.clock.tick(15)

    def handle_events(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                self.running = False
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP and self.snake.direction != (0, 10):
                    self.snake.direction = (0, -10)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and self.snake.direction != (0, -10):
                    self.snake.direction = (0, 10)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and self.snake.direction != (10, 0):
                    self.snake.direction = (-10, 0)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and self.snake.direction != (-10, 0):
                    self.snake.direction = (10, 0)

    def update(self):
        self.snake.move()
        if self.snake.body[0] == self.food.position:
            self.snake.grow()
            self.food.spawn(self.width, self.height)
        if self.snake.check_collision(self.width, self.height):
            self.running = False

    def draw(self):
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        for segment in self.snake.body:
            pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (0, 255, 0), pygame.Rect(segment[0], segment[1], 10, 10))
        pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 0, 0), pygame.Rect(self.food.position[0], self.food.position[1], 10, 10))
        pygame.display.flip()
```

### Summary
This implementation provides a complete Snake game with a scoring system and game-over detection. The game can be run by executing the `snake_game.py` file. The game logic is separated into different classes for better organization and maintainability.
