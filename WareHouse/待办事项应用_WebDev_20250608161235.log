To address the customer's request for a simple to-do list management application that supports adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete, we need to consider the most suitable product modality. 

Given the requirements, I suggest we develop this as an "Application" since it allows for interactive features and user engagement, which are essential for a task management tool. 

What are your thoughts on this modality?

I agree that developing it as an "Application" is a strong choice. It will provide users with a seamless experience for managing their tasks interactively. Additionally, we can implement features like notifications and user-friendly interfaces, which are crucial for a to-do list application. 

Do you have any other suggestions or thoughts on this modality?

I completely agree with your points. Developing it as an "Application" will indeed allow us to create a user-friendly interface and incorporate interactive features that enhance the user experience. Furthermore, we can leverage Python's capabilities to ensure smooth functionality and responsiveness. 

Since we both see the value in this modality, shall we conclude our discussion?

Here is a new customer's task: 开发一个简单的待办事项管理应用，支持添加、删除和标记完成任务.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "开发一个简单的待办事项管理应用，支持添加、删除和标记完成任务".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
